        <h1> Before We Can Look Into The Story, Lets Look At The content of the Games:</h1>
        <p>
        <br>
        

<h3>1.FNAF 1: </h3>
The story begins with Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, a family restaurant known for its animatronic characters. These animatronics, including Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy, are possessed by the souls of murdered children. The main antagonist is William Afton, also known as the Purple Guy, who murders the children and becomes responsible for their souls possessing the animatronics. The game's night guard must survive five nights while avoiding the animatronics.
</p>
 <br>
<h3>2. FNAF 2:</h3>
The prequel to FNAF 1, FNAF 2, introduces a new Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location and a new set of animatronics, including Toy versions of the original characters. Afton, working as a security guard, is responsible for more murders. The Puppet, a mysterious character, places the souls of the murdered children into the new animatronics. The game's night guard must survive their shifts while dealing with the aggressive animatronics.
</p>
 <br>
<h3>3. FNAF 3:</h3>
In this installment, the original animatronics have been replaced with Phantom versions that are hallucinations or representations of the spirits' agony. Afton, after his death, becomes Springtrap after being trapped in a springlock suit. The game is set in a horror attraction called "Fazbear's Fright," where Springtrap is discovered. The player must navigate the attraction while avoiding Springtrap's attacks.
</p>
 <br>
<h3>4. FNAF 4:</h3>
FNAF 4 is by far, the scariest game in the series. The lore is predomenately presented as a series of minigames and portrays the story of the Bite of '83, where a child is bitten by one of the animatronics, leading to severe injuries. The child's older brother and his friends torment him, and the child's fear and agony lead to the creation of Nightmare animatronics. The identity of the victim in this incident is heavily debated.
</p>
 <br>
<h3>5. Sister Location:</h3>
Sister Location introduces a new setting, where Afton's daughter, Elizabeth, is killed by the animatronic Circus Baby. Afton's motivation to experiment with remnant (a substance containing the souls of the dead) drives much of the story. The game explores themes of robotic possession and the control Afton exerts over his creations.
</p>
 <br>
<h3>6. FNAF 6: Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator:</h3>
This game introduces a simulation aspect where players run their own pizzeria. It is revealed that Afton returns as a presence known as "Scraptrap" and burns in the fire at the end of the game, seemingly ending his existence.
</p>
<br>
<h3>7. FNAF: Help Wanted:</h3>
A virtual reality game where players experience various events from the past games. Glitches and anomalies indicate that the in-game world might be connected to the real world in unsettling ways.
</p>
<br>
<h3>8. FNAF: Security Breach & Ruin </h3>
This game features the large Freddy Fazbear's Mega Pizza Plex and introduces new characters, including Glamrock animatronics. It continues the storyline of the previous games and delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding remnant and the connection between the virtual and real worlds in the ruin DLC (Downloadable Content)

        <h2>Now onto the somewhat confirmed storyline of Five Nights At Freddy's</h2>
        <p>
           
Opening of Fredbear’s Family Diner
</p>

Two entrepreneurs, Henry Emily and William Afton start Fredbear’s Family Diner,
a restaurant featuring pizza, and robotic animals to entertain the children. The
business is so successful that the two establish Fazbear Entertainment, and
expand to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.
</p>
Springlock Suits
</p>

Henry invented special animatronics that doubled as costumes for employees to
wear. However, these suits were extremely dangerous. The slightest tap to the
crank could set free the animatronic parts, crushing the performer inside.
</p>
The Missing Childrens Incident
</p>

One day at Freddy’s, William puts on a costume of one of the characters and
leads a girl named Susie into the backroom, saying he had found her lost puppy.
He murders her, and hides her inside the Chica animatronic. He does this several
more times. The other victims where Gabriel, Jeremy, Frits, and Cassidy. Growing
concerned for his daughters safety, Henry installs a new animatronic called the
Puppet to look after her.
</p>
The Murder of Charllotte Emily.
</p>

It is Henry’s daughter, Charlotte’s birthday. Several kids lock her outside of the
building and laugh as she cries trying to get back in. Eventually, William shows up
in his car, and murders her. The Puppet comes out of the restaurant to find the
little girl dead outside the building. Charlotte’s spirit goes on to possess the
puppet.
</p>
Closing of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza
</p>

After the missing children incident, Fazbear Entertainment struggled to keep
Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza in business. Parent’s no longer felt comfortable bringing
their children there.
</p>
The opening and closing of Circus Baby’s Pizza
World.
</p>

William decides to expand the business and open yet another restaurant. He
designs the new Funtime Animatronics to be able to lure away and kidnap
children. He tells his daughter, Elizabeth, to stay away from the animatronics.
However, Elizabeth defies her father. She goes up to Circus Baby and admires her
father’s work. When no one else is looking, the robot opens up and grabs
Elizabeth. The robot pulls her in and closes, crushing Elizabeth inside. Upon
realizing what had happened, William fakes a gas leak, and closes the restaurant.
He places the Funtime Animatronics in an underground facility, eventually
repurposing them for a rental service. Having witnessed the death of his sister,
William’s youngest son grew afraid of the animatronics.
</p>
The bite of ‘83
</p>

As the youngest’s birthday approaches, William’s oldest son, Michael, notices his
younger brother is afraid of the animatronics. He begins to torment him with a
Foxy mask. William has the little boy’s birthday at Fredbear’s Family Diner. Here,
Michael meets with his friends who laugh at his little brother for crying. They pick
him up and carry him towards Fredbear. They shove him inside the animatronic’s
jaw. To their shock, Fredbear’s mouth closed, crushing the child’s head. He is
taken to the hospital, where he has nightmares of the animatronics tormenting him
until he eventually passes away in his sleep. Fredbear’s Family Diner closes.
</p>
Grand reopening of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria
</p>

In 1987, Fazbear Entertainment brings back Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, with
advanced new animatronics, capable of walking around the restaurant to entertain
patrons all over the building.They also featured a facial recognition system, able to
alert staff immediately upon spotting a criminal. Most of the original animatronics
are kept to be used for parts, with the exception of the puppet, who was used
alongside the new models.
</p>
William works the nightshift
</p>

In the new pizzeria, William worked as a night security guard. He discovers that
the older animatronics are haunted by the children he had killed years ago. One
night, several teenagers break into the restaurant. They are caught by william, and
murdered. Their souls go on to haunt the new animatronics. At the end of the
week, William moves to the day shift, and is replaced by Jeremy Fitzgerald.
